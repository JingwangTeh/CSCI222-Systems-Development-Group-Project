Week 5 Meeting #3 - 26 August 2016

Summary
In this meeting, we review our use case according to requirements gathered from previous Q&A and identified changes that need to be made, 
while associating functionalities with the existing draft of our user interface. 

Also, we ensure all group members are aware of the current progress of the project, and distributes the remaining tasks to each group
