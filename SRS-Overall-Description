OVERALL DESCRIPTION
PRODUCT PERSPECTIVE
Currently, there are various organizations with various software products, in which all have the potential to introduce bugs that could be simply be a nuisance or it could be something critical to the core operations of the system itself. However, not many organizations consider the need to implement a way to track and manage the bugs related to their system.

Therefore, it has come to a point where the need for a bug tracking system for any organization focused on software products, whether it be a start-up or a medium-sized organization, is necessary in order to effectively assist them in managing bugs to maintain their software product. 

Our bug tracking systems aims to provide the functionality of a bug tracking system without the reliance on software product type, or organizational size.
